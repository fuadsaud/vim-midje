vim-midje
=========
`vim-midje` provides Vim indentation and syntax highlighting for
[Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje), a Clojure test framework.

Prerequisites
-------------
`vim-midje` assumes that Clojure runtime files are available. Vim versions
7.3.803 and later ship with them. If you're using an older version of Vim, then
you will need to install
[vim-clojure-static](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static) or
[VimClojure](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501).

Installation
------------
Assuming that you are using
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), installation is simply a
matter of:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git@github.com:gregspurrier/vim-midje.git
